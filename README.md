# Group11-Assign4-JUnit Testing of Trigonometric Functions
In this assignment we will teste and implement some trigonometric functions using Junit and following the TDD approach.

#Functions Being Tested
1.sin()
2.cos()
3.tan()
4.DegToRad()
5.normalizedRad()
6.factorial()
7.power()

#Tesing strategy
Since it is not possible to test every possible input, we are going to use the following testing methodologies: 
1. Testing Boundaries.
2. Testing Equivalence Partitions.
3. Testing Educational Guesses.
