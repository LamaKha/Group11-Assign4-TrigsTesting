# Group11Assign4
JUnit Testing of Trigonometric Functions
In this assignment we will teste and implement some trigonometric functions using Junit and following the TDD approach.

# Functions Being Tested
1.sin()
2.cos()
3.tan()
4.DegToRad()
5.normalizedRad()
6.factorial()
7.power()

# Tesing strategy
Since it is not possible to test every possible input, we are going to use the following testing methodologies: 
1. Testing Boundaries.
2. Testing Equivalence Partitions.
3. Testing Educational Guesses.

#Process of commiting and pushing to github (Terminal version or CMD)
1. git clone https://github.com/LamaKha/Group11-Assign4-TrigsTesting.git
2. cd Group11-Assign4-TrigsTesting/
3. git branch       (this will show you your current brances if any or just give out "Master" as branch name)
4. git branch yourBranchName      (this will create the branch of ur specified name for example "git branch faraz1" will create faraz1 as branch)
5. git checkout yourBranchName      (this will shift your workflow from Master branch to your branch to which you can commit and push without changing master branch, this avoids us to accidental pushes to the main branch, example "git checkout faraz1" will shift me to my branch as faraz1)
6. Open your project in any ide prefferably intellij but if you guys face any issues in other ide's let me know. Then change anything in the code or update it then save it.
7. git status     (this will give you some red files that are modified like the code file names just dont add "out" directory which is your output and which is not required here)
8. git add file1 file2 ..etc    (this  will add the required files to the cache which you can commit and then push separate different files by space)
9. git commit -m "your message about the commit"  (this commits your changes and the message is just for logs and to get what was done)
10. git push -u origin yourBranchName   (this will push the branch to the github which i will review and then i will merge it to the repository)

if you have any more questions let me know.
